            "\n",
            "**Let's start with the Basics: What is a Function Graph?**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **The Idea:** A function graph visually represents the relationship between two variables. We typically call these variables 'x' and 'y'.\n",
            "*   **Ordered Pairs:** Every point on the graph corresponds to an ordered pair (x, y), which satisfies the function. For example, the point (2, 5) on a graph means when x = 2, the corresponding y-value is 5.\n",
            "*   **X and Y Axes:**\n",
            "    *   The **x-axis** (horizontal) usually represents the input values (also called the domain).\n",
            "    *   The **y-axis** (vertical) usually represents the output values (also called the range).\n",
            "*   **Plotting:** To draw a graph, you usually plug in several x-values into your function and calculate the corresponding y-values. These (x, y) pairs become points that you plot and connect.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Key Concepts:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Intercepts:** These are points where the graph crosses the x or y axes.\n",
            "    *   **X-intercept:** The point where the graph crosses the x-axis. The y-value is always 0 at this point. To find it, you set y=0 in the function and solve for x.\n",
            "    *   **Y-intercept:** The point where the graph crosses the y-axis. The x-value is always 0 at this point. To find it, you set x=0 in the function and solve for y.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Slope:** The slope describes how steep a line is. It's represented by the letter 'm' and is calculated as the \"rise over run.\"\n",
            "    *   **Formula:** `m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)` where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are any two points on the line.\n",
            "    *   **Positive Slope:** The line goes upward from left to right.\n",
            "    *   **Negative Slope:** The line goes downward from left to right.\n",
            "    *   **Zero Slope:** The line is horizontal (a flat line).\n",
            "    *   **Undefined Slope:** The line is vertical (it's a straight up-and-down line).\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Different Function Types (Key Examples in Algebra)**\n",
            "\n",
            "    *   **Linear Functions:** These form straight lines. The general form is `y = mx + b`, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept.\n",
            "        *   Example: y = 2x + 3 (Slope = 2, Y-intercept = 3)\n",
            "    *   **Quadratic Functions:** These form parabolas (U-shaped curves). The general form is `y = ax^2 + bx + c`.\n",
            "        *   Example: y = x^2 - 4x + 3\n",
            "    *   **Exponential Functions:**  These exhibit rapid growth or decay. The general form is `y = a * b^x`, where 'a' is the initial value and 'b' is the growth/decay factor.\n",
            "        *   Example: y = 2^x\n",
            "    *  **Absolute Value Functions:** These form a V-shape. The general form is `y = a|x - h| + k`\n",
            "        *  Example: y = |x - 2| + 1\n",
            "\n",
            "**Let's start with some examples:**\n",
            "\n",
            "**Example 1: Linear Function**\n",
            "\n",
            "Let's look at the function: `y = 3x - 6`\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Y-intercept:** Set x = 0: `y = 3(0) - 6 = -6`. The y-intercept is (0, -6).\n",
            "2.  **X-intercept:** Set y = 0: `0 = 3x - 6`. Solving for x: `3x = 6`, so `x = 2`. The x-intercept is (2, 0).\n",
            "3.  **Slope:** The slope (m) is the number multiplied by x, which is 3. This means for every one unit moved to the right on the graph, the line goes 3 units up.\n",
            "4.  **Graphing:** Plot your intercepts (0,-6) and (2,0). Then connect them to draw the line.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Example 2: Quadratic Function**\n",
            "\n",
            "Let's look at the function: `y = x^2 - 4`\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Y-intercept:** Set x=0: `y = 0^2 - 4 = -4`. The y-intercept is (0,-4)\n",
            "2.  **X-intercepts:** Set y=0: `0= x^2 -4`, add 4 to both sides: `4=x^2`. Take square roots: `x= +/- 2`. The x-intercepts are (-2, 0) and (2, 0).\n",
            "3.  **Graphing:** Plot those 3 points. You should see a parabola that opens upwards. The parabola is symmetrical about the vertex. The vertex is midway between the roots, so the vertex x coordinate is (2 + (-2)) /2 = 0. Plugging that in `y = 0^2-4 = -4`, which is the y-intercept, it should also be the vertex. Now, you can just make a few extra x,y points and then connect them in a parabola.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Your Turn!**\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, I'd like you to try this:\n",
            "\n",
            "Consider the function `y = -2x + 4`.\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  Find the y-intercept.\n",
            "2.  Find the x-intercept.\n",
            "3.  What is the slope of the line?\n",
            "4. Try to sketch the graph using just the x and y intercept on a paper/notebook.\n",
            "\n",
            "After you've tried those, we can discuss any questions you have.\n",
            "\n",
            "I'm here to guide you, so don't hesitate to ask if anything isn't clear!\n",

            "    *   **Summer (March to May):** Hot and humid, temperatures often reach 35-40°C (95-104°F) or even higher, especially in May. Coastal areas offer some relief with sea breezes.\n",
            "    *   **Monsoon Season (June to August):** While not as rainy as other parts of Pakistan, Karachi experiences some monsoon showers during this period. Humidity remains high, and temperatures are still warm.\n",
            "    *   **Post-Monsoon (September to October):** Temperatures and humidity gradually start to decrease, with pleasant weather in October.\n",
            "    *   **Winter (November to February):** Mild and dry, with average temperatures ranging from 15-25°C (59-77°F). It's the most pleasant time of the year in Karachi.\n",
            "*   **Rainfall:** Karachi doesn't receive a lot of rainfall annually. Most of the rain occurs during the monsoon season.\n",
            "*   **Sea Breezes:** Karachi's proximity to the Arabian Sea means it often experiences sea breezes, which provide some relief from the heat, especially during the afternoon.\n",

            "*   **Monsoon Winds:** The monsoon season brings moist air from the Arabian Sea.\n",
            "*   **Heat Waves:** During summer, Karachi can experience heat waves, which can be dangerous if precautions are not taken.\n",
            "*   **Climate Change:** Like many places, Karachi's weather patterns are increasingly influenced by climate change, leading to more extreme temperatures and unpredictable weather.\n",
